# Smaller-Projects

This is a repository that contains all the smaller projects that I've done using the various languages I know. Each project is assigned a folder which contains the project itself as well as a README.md file which contains the instructions/functionality of the project. Here are the projects assigned by date (DD/MM/YY) in ascending order as well as the language they are written in:





1. [Credit Card Checker](https://github.com/MadhavMenon1007/Smaller-Projects/tree/main/Credit%20Card%20Checker)- 6/6/2021 - JavaScript
