# Smaller-Projects

This is a repository that contains all the smaller projects that I've done using the various languages I know. Each project is assigned a folder which contains the project itself as well as a README.md file which contains the instructions/functionality of the project. Here are the projects assigned by date (DD/MM/YY) in ascending order as well as the language they are written in:





1. [my directory](Credit Card Checker) - 5/6/2021 to 6/6/2021 - 

2. [my directory](Mysterious Organism) - 6/6/2021 - ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)
