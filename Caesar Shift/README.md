# Caesar Shift 

This is a simple implementation of a Caesar Shift. A Caesar Shift is a basic cryptographic algorithm in which letters in an alphabet are substituted by other letters in an alphabet based on a letter shift which is passed in as a key.

For example:

Plain Text: "Hello World"

Key: 2

Cipher Text: "JgnnqYqtnf"

This is because each letter in plain text is shifted to the right by 2 letters. Therefore H gets shifted to a J and so on. 

There is also a decrypter which takes in a message and the key that was used to shift the plain text into that decrypted message.
