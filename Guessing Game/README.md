The aim of this project was for the computer to think of a number from 1-10. The player then has to guess this number, each incorrect guess leads to them losing a "life". Each player has 3 "lives". I wanted to make it as advanced as possible such as rejecting non integer inputs and asking the player if they want to play again so they don't have to keep running the program.
