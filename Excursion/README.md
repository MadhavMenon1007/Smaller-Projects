# Excursion

This is a Codecademy off platform project which tested my knowledge of HTML/CSS, the Command Line as well as Git and GitHub. Here is the context of the assignment:

The web page we’ll build advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so we’ll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.

This project is done with the aid of a design and redline mock given to us.
